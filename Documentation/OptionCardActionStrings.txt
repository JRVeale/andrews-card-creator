GOTO(7)
# If the option should result in simply go to a card (rather than do other stuff, or ifs etc)
# then can just write the number as the full action string. i.e
7
# This is to make parsing possible cards to go to much simpler for the

GET(B)

# VARIABLES CAN BE NAMED GAME VARIABLES, OR ONE OF A SET OF TEMPORARY VARIABLES:

temp_b
temp_c
temp_d
temp_e
# (THESE ARE ONLY STORED FOR A SPECIFIC OPTION)

# DO C THEN D
